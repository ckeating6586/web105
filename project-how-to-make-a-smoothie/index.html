        <h2>When Should You Have A Protein Smoothie</h2>
        <p>Protein smoothies can be enjoyed at any time of day. You can use them as meal replacements if you are trying to lose or maintain a certain weight. You can also
            use them as a recovery drink after a workout. 
        </p>

        <h2>How Do You Pick Your Ingredients?</h2>
        <p>I generally like to pick a variety of ingredients. I like to choose a fruit that tends to be on the sweet side
            and a fruit that is on the tarte side. I feel that having both a sweet and a tarte, creates a better balance of flavor. 
            I sometimes like to add a cup of green leafy vegetables, like spinach or kale. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I always choose a protein powder to add into my
            smoothies because I notice I never get enough protein in my day. </p>
