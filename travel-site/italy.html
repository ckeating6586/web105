                </p>
                <p>While in Italy, I stayed in Venice. There was an iconic cathedral called St. Mark Basilica that was
                    one of
                    the most gorgeous churches I had ever seen. Also in that square you could find people feeding
                    pigeons that would also
                    fly on your shoulder.

                <p>Also while in Italy, I visited the glass blowing island called Murano. Here
                    you can see live demonstrations of glass blowing artists making glass art.

                </p>
                <p>Burano is a Venetian island that is known for it's lace. Their lace making dates centuries back. A
                    lot of lace
                    from Burano was purchased by royalty.
