        <h2>The recipes</h2>

        stories to explain the history of the dishes and what the names mean.</p>
        <h3>Reviews</h3>
        <p>Michaels, a former contestant on MasterChef UK, debuts with an inspired collection packed with anecdotes and excellent 
        recipes from Greece, with a focus on the food of Cyprus, where his family has roots. 
        The fare is appropriately light and well-suited to sunny climes: a ceviche of sea bream 
        includes cubes of watermelon; a wheat berry, quinoa, and pomegranate salad is inspired 
        by kolifa, a dish usually served during Greek Orthodox memorial services. A chapter on 
        fish and seafood includes grilled octopus served on a bed of lentils stained black with 
        squid ink, as well as pretty packages of cod loin encased in pastry shreds. Clever ideas 
        abound: vegetables are shaved into ribbons for a salad of zucchini, carrots, and 
        asparagus; in a chapter on cooking with fire, disks of goat cheese are wrapped in 
        pancetta and grilled. Desserts are equally evocative: baklava is flavored with espresso 
        and a chocolate sauce, then smoked over wood chips in a nod to memories of 
        “leathery-skinned old men playing backgammon in the street outside a café, dark bitter 
        coffee perfuming the air and camouflaging the smoke from their cigarettes, and something 
        sweet served on a tea saucer.” This is a transporting book that beautifully blends 
        flavor and memory. (Apr.)</p>
        <h2>In conclusion</h2>
        <p>Theo Michaels says in his introduction of the book <q>Personally, I believe the heritage of Greek food is not 
        simply about the ingredients, but is a combination of the people, their lands, and history and adaptability
        of a nation that are all bound by an unbroaken thread woven through the tapestry of Greek and Cypriot culture.</q></p>
